# Data Science - John Hopkins University - Coursera Specialization 

This is a consolidated repository of assignments and projects done as part of [Coursera Data Science Specialization by John Hopkins](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).

Most source code is R code. Some projects rely on RStudio since they take advantage of Sweave, knittr, RPubs, ShinyApps, RMarkdown, etc.

The [capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project) can be found in my [text-prediction-swiftkey](https://github.com/bmaingret/text-prediction-swiftkey) repository.
